							<h2> My Philosophy</h2>
							<p>I vividly remember what it was like applying to college my senior year of high school: the hurricanes of competing advice from peers, classmates, parents and loose relatives alike. The college application process can be long and arduous, bringing about different problems for different people at different times and in different ways. It can be nice to be able to talk to someone who knows what it’s like to be in your shoes and didn’t apply to college in the ‘80s, someone who is attuned to the nuances of the modern college admissions landscape. Let me be that person for you! I pride myself on my empathetic approach to college coaching: a philosophy rooted as much in compassion as it is in candor and honesty.</p>
							<p><b>I believe in building relationships with my clients.</b>In fact, there really is no other way to effectively coach applicants through the admissions process. Working with me can be as professional or casual as you would like--whatever makes you most comfortable. Though I’ve found that most students enjoy a more casual, relaxed relationship with me, don’t think that a casual relationship means that the work will be any less rigorous. We will be working extremely close with each other, and building the foundations of trust, understanding, and empathy are crucial to our success together. A critical part of our working relationship is confidentiality, so let me assure you: <em>All information shared between the client and myself is always strictly and unequivocally confidential. I will never share your personal information with anyone without your explicit consent.</em>
							</p>
							<p>Ultimately, my goal is to give you the best chance possible to gain admission into the college of your choice. Whether your dream school is Harvard, UC Santa Barbara, Howard University, or University of Alabama, my goal is to help you find, select, and gain acceptance to a college where you will be happy, grow, and thrive. </p>
